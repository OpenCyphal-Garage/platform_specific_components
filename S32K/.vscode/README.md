Visual Studio Code
====================================

> vs studio support is provided only for maintaining the unit-tests in this project. You don't need any of this to use the S32K media layer for libuavcan.

A lot of the configuration here was borrowed from the [PX4 firmware project](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/.vscode/). Thanks [PX4 peeps](https://www.dronecode.org/) and thank you [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) for this great open-source IDE.

See the [libuavcan dev guide](https://uavcan.org/libuavcan/_lib_dev_guide.html) for full details on setting up vscode for libuavcan liburary development.
