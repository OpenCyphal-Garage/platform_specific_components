/// A generic low-level driver for the STM32 bxCAN macrocell. Designed to support any operating system and baremetal
/// systems. This driver is not compatible with FDCAN controllers available in newer STM32 MCUs such as STM32H7.
/// The driver has no external dependencies besides a tiny subset of the C standard library.
///
/// This driver exclusively supports extended-id frame format (29-bit) data frames. There is no support for the
/// classic-id (11-bit) data frames, remote frames, overload frames, or error frames. The 29 bits of the extended
/// identifier values used in this driver match the order of the CAN protocol, as described in the CAN 2.0B standard.
///
/// The driver does not use interrupts or critical sections internally, which makes it a good fit for certain hard
/// real-time systems where interrupts may be impossible to leverage (e.g., some motor control applications).
/// The application shall poll the RX queue with a sufficient frequency to prevent RX overrun. Given that the hardware
/// RX FIFO is three frames deep, the polling interval shall not exceed (shortest frame transmission time) x3.
/// At 1 Mbit/s for CAN 2.0B, this amounts to 192 microseconds. The application may be able to slightly extend
/// the interval by configuring the acceptance filters appropriately.
///
/// If the application is unable to poll the driver with a sufficient frequency, it is possible to enable the
/// interrupts and invoke the driver from there. It is safe since the driver is context-agnostic. Same holds for
/// the transmission management: it can be done by polling or from an interrupt depending on the timing requirements.
/// If interrupts are used, it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure adequate synchronization.
///
/// The driver automatically aborts all pending transmissions if the CAN controller enters the bus-off state.
/// This behavior is introduced to support the plug-and-play node-ID allocation protocol defined by Cyphal.
///
/// The driver does not support TX timestamping. This feature is only required for time synchronization masters.
/// The suggested alternative is to implement the required logic at the driver layer directly, as is often done
/// with some other precise time protocols such as IEEE 1588.
///
/// The clocks of the CAN peripheral shall be enabled by the application before the driver is initialized.
/// The driver cannot do that because this logic is not uniform across the STM32 family.
///
/// The CAN interface index counts from zero, as per the C convention. ST numbers the CAN peripherals starting
/// from 1. Thus: iface_index 0 = bxCAN1 and iface_index 1 = bxCAN2.
///
/// The recommended approach for integration is to copy-paste the source files into the project tree and modify
/// as necessary. The .c file does not require any specific build options.

/// copying into two queues, but this approach leads to increased memory utilization. A more conservative approach
/// is to keep a unified queue keeping the outgoing frames for both interfaces, and a single backlog queue keeping
/// the frames for the interface that is lagging behind. This way, no memory overutilization will occur. One backlog
